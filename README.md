# JARVIS

- **JARVIS** ("Junk" Annotation genome-wide Residual Variation Intolerance Score): a comprehensive deep learning framework to prioritise non-coding variants in whole genomes, using human-lineage purifying selection features and primary sequence context.

- gwRVIS (genome-wide Residual Variation Intolerance Score): a genome-wide intolerance to variation score


**Data availability**: genome-wide JARVIS and gwRVIS scores (calculated with > 62,000 whole genome sequences) are availabe for download in [Supplementary_File_1.tsv.gz](jarvis-gwrvis-scores/bed/Supplementary_File_1.tsv.gz) (BED format).

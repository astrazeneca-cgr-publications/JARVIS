Add:

- Results from score bencmarking, using either clinvar or hgmd as pathogenic, and clinvar, denovodb or topmed for benign! Already gives some very good resutls, either for gwRVIS alone or in combination with CADD, justifying the existence of a lot more information.

	-- Check also results with Random Forest (instead of DNN) 

- Results jarvis/variant_classification/run_variant_classification.py: OK (for intergeneic mainly, and a bit for UTRs)
